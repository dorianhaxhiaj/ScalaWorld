#My experience and further notes

Put here general information about the steps you took, what you liked, disliked, why did you do X instead of Y and so on.

## HDP Sandbox

Easy Task. 
The instructions where very explanatory and for me was easy to follow.

â€¢	My only issue here where the hardware requirement. I wasn't prepare with this requirement and this thing  made me consume to much time to find a way to do it.

## HDFS & Hive on Spark

This part was tricky for me because I need to make a huge research for understanding what is the role of Spark, hdfs, hive, Hadoop, hbase. They where you term and technology that I never faced in my work experience. 
The first thing that I did for setting up spark scala environment I used a example on horton tutorial: https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/setting-up-a-spark-development-environment-with-scala/

A problem that I faced was, where and how to test my code. In remote or local. With both of them I faced configuration bugs. Specifically in remote it was very difficult to test because where the virtual machine , it slowed down my computer and it was very hard to work on it.
